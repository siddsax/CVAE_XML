1) Label subsets created via clustering (via SLEEC, normal KMeans fails miserably) make sense to a reasonable extent, there 
    are some labels in clusters but they are limited to at most one or two some 
    clusters ( say with 12-20 labels in each cluster). While also not being common 
    sensical that each cluster has labels that co-occur always

2) TF_IDF data is sparse, out of 5000, say 200 have some value and all others are zero. This is 
    not being translated to generated data, which has much more spread out values with lower maximum 
    value as well. 

3) The data being created is not having much sense more often than not, Even though the labels do. It is possible 
    however that the important features get lost in a sea of unimportant ones as the features are not sparse or 
    Fast-XML suffers on data that is not sparse. 



Do classification as per the dilation paper

h -> y_pred
h -> z_m

z_v, z_m -> z
z,y_pred -> x
